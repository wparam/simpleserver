`sherpa-proxy` is a programmable HTTP proxy, which primarily redirects requests from sherpa web-services. 
It supports failover and other configuration options which are needed for correct request forwarding and securing.

This project is heavily inspired by https://github.com/nodejitsu/node-http-proxy.
